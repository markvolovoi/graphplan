# Graphplan Visualizer

Implemented by Annarose Hilhorst, Mark Volovoi, and Ava Wandersleben for the final project of GT's CS3511. This aims to implement the planning algorithm outlined in the 1995 paper [Fast Planning Through Planning Graph Analysis](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/graphplan.pdf), as well as provide a web based visualizer for understanding the algorithm.

This is a Vite, Tailwind, and Solid project. This might be bad but we can change it.
